	<p>QUEENS, N.Y. -- No need to travel to Cape Cod: Humpback whales and bottlenose dolphins are right in the backyard of Staten Islanders.</p>

	<p>In the shadows of Manhattan skyscrapers and the Verazzano-Narrows Bridge, a humpback whale and a pod of dolphins wowed passengers aboard the American Princess whale-watching tour Sunday afternoon in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

	<p>Just a short drive from Staten Island, the American Princess leaves from Riis Landing in Rockaway, Queens. On Sunday, the boat headed out into the Jamaica Bay Inlet with a full ship of eager passengers waiting to spot a whale.</p>

	<p>As the boat turned out of the mouth of the harbor into Ambrose Channel, Catherine Granton, naturalist and assistant director of Gotham Whale, pointed to Manhattan's skyline through the haze.</p>

	<p>"I want you to pause for a moment and consider, here we are in the shadow so to speak of the Manhattan skyline. We're out here in Rockaway, I like to call it the backyard," she said. "And we're here to see humpback whales and bottlenose dolphins, magnificent marine mammals in their natural habitat."</p>

	<blockquote>And it wasn't long before Capt. Tom Paladino spotted a large splash out in the distance. As the boat neared, water spouted from the blowhole of a large humpback whale.</blockquote>

	<p>"Mostly finding the whales is intuition. You have to go where they were yesterday, look for the bait. Usually, when you find the bait and the bait balls, the whales aren't too far away," Paladino said.</p>

	<p>Just three or four miles off Sandy Hook, the whale emerged from the water, mouth wide open, gobbling menhaden -- what fishermen call "bunker" -- by the thousands.</p>

	<p>"We saw what's called a lunge feed and that's about 30,000 pounds of animal coming up out of the water and it's just amazing to think that that's happening within a background of the island of Manhattan. We can see the skyscrapers in the distance when we see these animals," said Paul Sieswerda, founder and director of Staten Island-based Gotham Whale, a not-for-profit organization that works with American Princess to study and research whales in the New York-New Jersey area.</p>

	<h2>What are whales and dolphins doing in New York City?</h2>

	<p>During the winter, the whales spend their time in the warmer waters of the Caribbean, mating and reproducing. In the springtime, they head up north to find fish to eat and replenish their fat.</p>


	<p>As the ocean in the New York area has become cleaner over the years and filled with more fish like bunker, more whales have stayed around New York City and the Jersey Shore instead of continuing further north.</p>

	<p>"If you look at hand-drawn maps from the 1700s, whales figured prominently in our waters. But what happened over the years was the water became too oxygen-depleted, too dirty. There wasn't enough food resource here for them," Granton said. "Because of legislation like the Clean Water Act, like the Clean Air Act that were signed in back in the '70s -- it took 40-plus years for them to show fruit -- that's why we have the biodiversity that we're seeing today. The water is so much cleaner than it was back in the day."</p>

	<p>Paladino agrees. "The environment is getting better, everybody is getting more educated on taking care of the planet and it is really showing."</p>

	<p>He said that they would see only one or two whales a year back in the '60s through the '80s, but now they see more whales every year.</p>

	<p>"In 2015 and 2016, [the American Princess whale watching tour] had over 90 percent sightings. Now if you had told me that 10 years ago, I would have said you're crazy, but it has just exploded in the New York area," Paladino said. "Until the last 10 years, if somebody wanted to go whale-watching, everybody went to Cape Cod. Now you don't have to, it's right in your backyard. There's as many whales some days here as in Cape Cod."</p>

	<h2>Familiar Fins</h2>

	<p>As passengers exclaimed in awe of the large marine mammals, crew members and the Gotham Whale team were just as excited to spot the magnificent animals as if it had been their first time. They do, however, have a few favorites and have even named some, which they can identify by their dorsal fins and behavior.</p>

	<p>There was Gotham, a humpback whale who made its way into New York Harbor all the way up to the George Washington Bridge over the course of about five days in November 2016.</p>

	<blockquote>"That whale was tracked by over 20 individuals, regular folks looking out their windows," Sieswerda said. "One woman was from an Upper West Side apartment building and other people on the Staten Island Ferry and reports from all over."</blockquote>

	<p>On the top deck of the American Princess on Sunday, Gotham Whale's staff photographer, Artie Raslich, could be heard shouting that the whale swimming nearby could be Jerry. The Gotham Whale staff has seen Jerry for about four years in a row, Sieswerda said.</p>

	<p>Raslich first encountered the whale on his own boat, The Ship of Fools. As he blasted the Grateful Dead on his stereo, the whale swam toward the boat. With the Empire State Building in the background, the whale then "spy hopped," or held itself vertically in order to keep its head above the water line and perhaps listen to the music. The move earned the whale the name Jerry after the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia.</p>

	<p>On what makes whale-watching in the wild so spectacular, Granton said, "We're going out to find marine animals in their natural habitat, doing what they would be doing whether we're there or not and that's the beauty of it."</p>
